Instigator attempts to push the boundaries of the Wildstar chat API by allowing the user to spam emotes, set up timers for spamming text, and paste in large blocks of text (e.g., ASCII spam) which will be sent line by line to any channel of your choosing. Current functionality:

* /mad to open window
* Do an emote on a user-configure timer (e.g., hide your animations with /laugh every 0.1 seconds)
* Emote automatically when killing other players
* Say something every X seconds to any channel
* Paste large blocks of text to any channel (e.g., ASCII spam)
